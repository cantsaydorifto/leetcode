Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into 
a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

loop through all the possible substrings and check if
they belong to the dict,
we need to find the first part of the space separated 
word

once we've found that, call the function again for
the rest of the string
